        <p>It's long been thought surgical masks protect from transmission of pathogens, which spread through the air on large, short-range droplets, while respirators protect against much smaller, airborne particles, which may remain suspended in the air
            for several hours and transmit infection over long distances.</p>

        <p>This webpage provides advice for using a disposable N95 mask, if needed, for flood recovery and cleanup work. A disposable N95 mask (respirator) is a safety device that covers the nose and mouth and helps protect the wearer from breathing in some
            hazardous substances. An N95 mask protects you from breathing in small particles in the air such as dust and mold. It is designed to filter out at least 95% of the dust and mold in the air. </p>

        <p>Hand sanitizer is a liquid or gel generally used to decrease infectious agents on the hands. Formulations of the alcohol-based type are preferable to hand washing with soap and water in most situations in the healthcare setting.[4][5] It is generally
            more effective at killing microorganisms and better tolerated than soap and water. Hand washing should still be carried out if contamination can be seen or following the use of the toilet.[7] The general use of non-alcohol based versions has
            no recommendations.[4] Outside the health care setting, hand washing is generally preferred.They are also less effective for microorganisms norovirus, and Clostridium difficile.[8] They are available as liquids, gels, and foams.[6] Alcohol-based
            versions typically contain some combination of isopropyl alcohol, ethanol (ethyl alcohol), or n-propanol. Versions that contain 60 to 95% alcohol are most effective.[6] Care should be taken as they are flammable.[4] Alcohol-based hand sanitizer
            works against a variety of microorganisms but not spores. Some versions contain compounds such as glycerol to prevent drying of the skin.</p>
